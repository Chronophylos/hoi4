# Combat Width

![Figure with ideal Combat Width](./combat_width.png)

The effectiveness of a Combat Width depends on the Theatre but I'll ignore the
differences. Fabricensis<sup>[\[Fabr2021\]][Fabr2021]</sup> goes into more detail
regarding these differences in his report on Combat Widths.

Furthermore he concludes,

> 10 widths are on paper the best divisions. However it is difficult to balance
> their stats, especially with support companies. For small countries however,
> it is very viable to build up a small military with many low width divisions.
>
> 27 seems to be the best rounded width in the medium range, 25 should be
> avoided.
>
> If you can afford the industrial and supply cost, 41 to 45 is a high plateau,
> leading to some wiggle room.
>
> All in all, the differences between different widths are quite small, so it
> can still be a good strategy to build specialized divisions, like 30 or 45
> width tanks or 25 width mountaineers
